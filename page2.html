                <h2>Exercise 2 (Headings and Paragraphs)</h2>
                <h1>Comparative Performance of Rice (IR64 Var.) As Affected by Planting Methods (Farmer's Planting Practice and Row Method with 
            Varying Distance) </h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Nature and Importance of the Study</h4>
            <p>Oryza sativa L., the most commonly cultivated rice species belongs to sub-family Pooideae of the grass family Poaceae. Rice, 
                considering its grains obtained do cultivated for food consumption but, some industrial institutions as to small poultry production
                industries utilizes rice hulls as an alternative for expensive broader and/or incubator, others such in cattle raising led their 
                livestocks to fed on young shoots of rice stubbles. Rice growing environment vary significantly in different localities within and
                between countries; to wit are: Irrigated Environment, Rainfed Lowland Environment, Deepwater Environment, The Upland Environment, 
                and Tidal Wetlands (Misra, et al, 1994).</p>
            <p>From its initial point or points of cultivation, rice (Oryza sativa, L.) locally known as "palay" has spread over a considerable part 
                of the world and accounts for more than 50% of major staples consumed in Asia where more than 90% of the world's rice is grown 
                (Hsieh, et al, 1982).</p>
            <p>Rice farming is a way of life for most Filipinos where 70% the total population is dependent on its production, processing, 
                distribution, and marketing. About 3 million farmers distributed along the many islands of the country are actually involved in rice 
                farming. Of the total value for agricultural produce, 14% comes from rice. (PhilRice, 2000). But food production rates are 
                insufficient to keep pace with growth demand, especially in the poor and populous countries (Allaby, et al, 1977).</p>
            <p>Unemployment, hunger and poverty are deeply rooted in political and economic relation among and within nations, hence, 
                fundamental changes in patterns of resource ownership, food production, trade, and finance are needed so that the developing countries 
                can break the cycle of hunger, poverty, stagnant agricultural productivity, unemployment, high birth rates, and mortality. Thus, food 
                production per season is only one component of the complex necesarry to alleviate world hunger (Hsieh, et al, 1982).</p> 
            </p>
            <p>To maximize the average yield per hectare of rice, the following factors should be considered: Planting at right age of seeding,
                adequate supply of complete fertilizer and correction of soil deficiencies, 
                adequate supply of irrigation water and/or water management, control of prevailing major diseases and pests, and proper practice 
                in tillage, among others. All these factors are fundamentals in increased rice production. However, there are still loopholes
                with the modern concept of improved cultural practices. In some cases, the cultural practices have to change with variety, form
                of nitrogen, distance, and water management (PhillRice, 2000).</p>
            <p>In the local sense, Calbayog City in particular where almost all of the farmers deals on rice production, their income income 
                depend on its grain yeild. Finding it hard to produce more yeilds because of the cultural practices used by the farmers, the 
                traditional method of planting and weeding inconvinience.</p>
            <p>The researchers, hence, conducted this study to provide an ample knowledge needed in increased rice production.</p>
            <h3>Objective of the Study</h3>
            <p>This study aimed to:</p>
            <p>1. Assess rice crop groth and development after transplanting until harvesting to both farmer's planting practice and row method
                of planting with varying distances;</p>
            <p>2. Compare the effects of rotary weeding and hand weeding to rice (IR64) variety under Row Method and Framers Planting 
                respectively; and</p>
            <p>3. Determine the most promising and economical treatment that would give the highest net returns.</p>
            <h3>Time and Place of the Study</h3>
            <p>This study was conducted at Brgy. May-Salong, Calbayog City from September 01, 2004 to January 15, 2005.</p>
            <h3>Scope and Limitation of the Study</h3>
            <p>This study was conducted at Brgy. May-Salong, Calbayog City for easy farm management and supervision. This covered only until
                after harvesting usng the specified row distances. IR64 variety of rice was used to determine its growth and development of 
                rice using two methods of planting.</p>

                <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2>
                <p>Exercise 2 provided me with a deeper appreciation for the precision and structure required in HTML coding. By converting a thesis Chapter 1 into an organized digital format, I learned how essential basic HTML tags are in developing clear, accessible academic materials. The task required attention to detail, as even a minor error could affect the accuracy and presentation of the entire page. This experience strengthened my discipline in coding, enhanced my understanding of foundational HTML elements, and highlighted the importance of accuracy in web development. Completing the exercise smoothly reinforced my confidence and marked a significant advancement in my technical skills.</p>
