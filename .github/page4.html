    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
    Maybe it's the way you say my name
    Maybe it's the way you play your game
    But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
    But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

    And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
    And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

    'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    And I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

    I think that you are the one for me
    'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy

    And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
    And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

    'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    And I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    All of the time

    Dandelion, into the wind you go
    Won't you let my darling know?
    Dandelion, into the wind you go
    Won't you let my darling know that?

    I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
    Oh, and I see forever in your eyes
    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
    Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

    I'm in a field of dandelions
    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
</pre>

<h3>Information/Background of the Song</h3>
    <li>"Dandelions" is a song by Canadian singer Ruth B., originally released as a promotional single from her 2017 album Safe Haven. It was re-issued separately in a "slowed + reverb" version in August 2021. In 2022, the song charted internationally after going viral on TikTok.</li>
    <li>Ruth B. called the track "probably the lightest and cutest song" on Safe Haven and said she started writing it after watching an interview with Sia, part of whose advice on songwriting was to choose a "pretty word" to "write around". Ruth B. then "look[ed] out the window" several weeks later and "saw a dandelion, and [...] started writing the song" in part because she thought "dandelion" was a "pretty word".</li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelions_(song)#:~:text=Background-,Ruth%20B.,was%20a%20%22pretty%20word%22.">Link</a>

                <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2>
                <p>In Exercise 4, I explored the integration of multimedia elements and list structures within HTML, working with tags such as ul, img, video, and audio, along with hyperlink elements for referencing sources. This exercise broadened my perspective on how diverse forms of media can coexist harmoniously within a webpage to create a richer and more dynamic user experience.
                    As I combined text, visual components, and audio-visual content, I began to understand how each element contributes a different layer of engagement. Images help convey information visually, videos provide a more immersive form of communication, and audio clips add depth and interactivity. The list structures further contributed to the clarity and organization of the content, demonstrating how purposeful layout choices can guide the reader’s attention.
                    While the exercise required careful planning and precise application of tags, it also encouraged creative expression. I found it fulfilling to build a webpage that not only functioned technically but also showcased personality and thoughtful design. Incorporating one of my favorite songs, “Dandelions,” made the task even more meaningful and reminded me that coding can be both analytical and expressive.
                    Ultimately, this activity strengthened my skills in multimedia integration and deepened my appreciation for HTML’s capacity to support interactive, engaging, and informative web experiences.</p>
